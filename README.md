# PlanetDemo

My small project, procedural planet generator. There wasn't any real reason for this, but I wanted to make something like this.

Here are some results:

It also includes dynamic LOD, which still requires some tuning. I am also not at all satisfied with the way planets look, so one day I will have to come back to it and change some things.

You can see video preview of it in work [here](https://youtu.be/G_tHhOffcnc)

I don't consider it finished just yet, there are many things to improve, but I will probably stop working on it for some time.  
If by any chance you want to use it (fully or some parts of it) - you are totally free to.

It was made using [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/) for graphics and all of the math  
I also used [OpenSimplexNoise.cs](https://gist.github.com/digitalshadow/134a3a02b67cecd72181)  
And finally [this post](http://blog.andreaskahler.com/2009/06/creating-icosphere-mesh-in-code.html) it may be old, but it taught me huge deal about icospheres

Rest of it was made by me,
